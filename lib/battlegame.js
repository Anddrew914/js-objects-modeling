/* Put a function that takes two units as arguments into the 'battle' variable. This function should pit the two characters against each other until one of them dies ('health' falls to 0 or below). The character with the higher 'speed' value goes first, but each unit has only a 50% chance of successfully attacking the other. Once one of the units dies, the function should return the surviving unit.*/
